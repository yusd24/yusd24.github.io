## **2024 TIMS Summer Program in Geometry**
###### **Venue**: R202, Astronomy Mathematics Bldg., NTU
###### **Date**: 7/10-7/20
###### **Aim and Scope**:

Singularity is ubiquitous and has become the main focus in the study of mathematics and physics. It not only provides a proper place to study generalizations of theories on smooth objects but also carries information to bridge two different models and their geometry. The 2024 TIMS Summer Program aims to bring together scholars in related areas and provide an opportunity to exchange their ideas. We will be focusing on recent developments of differential geometry, algebraic geometry, as well as quantum geometry related to conifold transitions and beyond, from both mathematical and physical aspects. Through the program, we hope to promote collaborations and benefit local young scholars at all levels.


###### **Organizers**
 - Wu-yen Chuang (NTU & TIMS)
 - Tsung-Ju Lee (NCKU)
 - Chin-Lung Wang (NTU & TIMS)

###### **Sponsor**
