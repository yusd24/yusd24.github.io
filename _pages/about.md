I am currently an assistant professor 
at National Cheng Kung University. 
I have been a faculty member in the department of Mathematics since Sept. 1st, 2023.

Before joining the department, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Center of 
Mathematical Sciences and Applications, Harvard University since Sept. 1st, 2018.
My mentor was Professor Shing-Tung Yau. I received my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from National Taiwan University 
under the supervisions of Professor [Chin-Lung Wang](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/~dragon/) and Professor [Hui-Wen Lin](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/%7Elinhw/).

My research interest lies in the intersection of algebraic geometry and complex geometry. 
I am interseted in the geometry of Calabiâ€“Yau varieties, especially their moduli spaces and degenerations.
